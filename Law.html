                Bharath Institute of Law (BIL) enters Indian legal education domain, and hosts new vistas of learning at
                comparatively comfortable cost. The world is looking at India to associate with modern institutions and
                come around designing ways and means to attract Indian youth to study abroad. The road to superior and
                competitively higher standards leads to Indiaâ€™s great many IITs, IIMs all over. Today the experiment for
                qualitatively enriched legal education came up effectively in the national law schools. BIL, a variant
                of legal education, is a modern species of its own kind and looks forward to bring in a wholesome
                environment blended with professional learning and training in advocacy, mastering methods and inner
                depth of the legal concepts thoroughly and has brought forth a realisable agenda to focus on research.
                Fine tuning its immense necessity, BIL plans to introduce a number of advanced centres of specialisation
                exclusively to concentrate on research. Students will be able to prosecute all these courses in the
                portals of the Institute and attain distinction.<br><br>

                The avowed object of the Institute is to cater to the needs of a cross section of the population. It is
                not for the elite to deny access to the ordinary to become extraordinary, instead, its aim is underlying
                in its principle of inclusive education and it pledges for producing extraordinary results identifying
                talents and skills and research acumen in every single student admitted to learn from BIL. It is open
                for the students to freely exercise choice of any subject, by option and make them comfortable to learn
                and master it. Learning is ones enjoyable pursuit as it communicates knowledge and inculcates
                intelligible intelligence to the budding lawyers of tomorrow. By providing and instilling in the young
                the confidence in what has been learnt and how to face the challenges of the world in giving solutions
                for the client the alumni of Bharath will have his merit tested by the training and exposure he earns
                through the regular courses and suitable training in clinical and court work. It is not only that
                Bharath aims for enablement and empowerment of the scholars under its fold, it is also that it has a
                quality textured and fine-tuned to be fit for professionalism in the bar, corporate concerns,
                administration, national and international policy making in a political market and services thereon.<br><br>

                Giving them a space and identity, Bharath will endeavour to build its infrastructure suitable for all
                types of learning leading one to be a complete lawyer.The primary objective of the Bharath Institute of
                Law is to evolve and impart the quality legal education. Recent evidence has demonstrated the continuing
                need for clinical legal education and the universities have to a serious and proactive stance to this
                form of pedagogic instruction.So on the wake of this scenario, our respected Dean Prof(Dr).A.Raghunadha
                Reddy, a visionary with practical insight made this law school to impart clinical legal education which
                class room based education fails.So this is a small step to enshrine the philosophy of legal education
                along with ethical values.<br><br>
